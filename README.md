# ETL-Pipeline-Ganz-Project

## Project Overview
The ETL Pipeline Ganz project is designed to extract data from various sources, transform it into a usable format, and load it into a data warehouse for analysis. This project demonstrates the full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, showcasing skills in data engineering, data cleaning, and data integration.

## How I Built It
I built the ETL pipeline using Python, leveraging various libraries and tools to ensure efficient and effective data processing:
- **Data Extraction**: Utilized APIs and web scraping techniques to gather data from multiple sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Loading**: Loaded the transformed data into a data warehouse using Apache Airflow for orchestration.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Programming**: Efficient and clean coding practices for data manipulation.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Warehousing**: Using Apache Airflow for orchestrating the ETL process.
- **API Integration**: Extracting data from various APIs.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites using BeautifulSoup.

## ETL Process Summary
1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from APIs and websites.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transform the data into a consistent format.
4. **Data Loading**: Load the transformed data into a data warehouse.

## Challenges Overcome
- **Data Quality Issues**: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values and outliers.
- **Integration of Multiple Data Sources**: Integrating data from various sources with different formats.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the ETL pipeline can handle large volumes of data.

## Accomplishments
- **Diverse Data Sources**: Successfully collected data from diverse sources.
- **Efficient ETL Pipeline**: Built an efficient ETL pipeline that processes data quickly and accurately.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensured data consistency and accuracy throughout the ETL process.
