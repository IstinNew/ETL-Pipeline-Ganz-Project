# ETL Pipeline Ganz Project

## Project Overview
The end-to-end EXTRACT -TRANSFER - LOAD (ETL) Pipeline Ganz project is designed to showcase an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. The project involves collecting data through web scraping or APIs, storing the data in a MySQL database, moving the pipeline to the cloud using Google Cloud Analytics, and automating the entire data collection and storage process.

## How I Built It
The project is built using Python for data processing, MySQL for data storage, and Google Cloud Analytics for cloud deployment. The key steps include:
- **Data Collection**: Extracting data from various sources using web scraping techniques and APIs.
- **Data Storage**: Storing the collected data in a MySQL database for structured storage and querying.
- **Pipeline to the Cloud**: Deploying the ETL pipeline to Google Cloud Analytics for scalability and reliability.
- **Pipeline Automation**: Automating the data collection and storage process using scheduling tools.

## Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- `queries/`: SQL run scripts for storage and querying.
- `data/`: Directory for data files, charts, presentations etc.
- `config/`: Configuration files for database and settings.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Programming**: Efficient coding practices for data manipulation and pipeline management.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Data Warehousing**: Using MySQL for data storage and Google Cloud Analytics for cloud deployment.
- **API Integration**: Extracting data from various APIs.
- **Web Scraping**: Using BeautifulSoup and Requests for data extraction from websites.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploying and managing ETL pipelines on Google Cloud Analytics.

## ETL Process Summary
1. **Data Collection**: Data is collected from multiple sources using web scraping and APIs.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality.
3. **Data Transformation**: Data is transformed into a consistent format suitable for analysis.
4. **Data Storage**: The transformed data is stored in a MySQL database.
5. **Pipeline to the Cloud**: The ETL pipeline is deployed to Google Cloud Analytics for better scalability and reliability.

## Challenges Overcome
- **Data Quality Issues**: Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure high-quality data.
- **Integration of Multiple Data Sources**: Efficiently managed data from diverse sources with varying formats.
- **Scalability**: Ensured the ETL pipeline can handle large datasets and scale as needed.

## Accomplishments
- **Diverse Data Sources**: Successfully integrated and processed data from multiple sources.
- **Efficient ETL Pipeline**: Built a robust pipeline that ensures timely and accurate data processing.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Successfully deployed the ETL pipeline to Google Cloud Analytics for enhanced performance and scalability.
- **Automation**: Automated the data collection and storage process, reducing manual intervention.
